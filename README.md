## Main project: Text Mining Female Masculinity in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century Britain
See "Text Mining Female Masculinity in Early Modern Britain.ipynb", and associated appendixes: "Appendix A - Corpus Summary & Ordering the Corpus.ipynb" and "Appendix B - Corpus Normalization.ipynb"

I explored gender fluidity in sixteenth and seventeenth-century Britain using a corpus of just over 1000 texts from the period. I created this corpus using 25,368 texts from Early English Books Online (EEBO), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and Evans Early American Imprints, and filtered them using key words/phrases and dates.
