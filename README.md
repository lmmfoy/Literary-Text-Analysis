## Main project: Text Mining Female Masculinity in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century Britain
_See **Text Mining Female Masculinity in Early Modern Britain.ipynb**, and associated appendixes: **Appendix A - Corpus Summary & Ordering the Corpus.ipynb** and **Appendix B - Corpus Normalization.ipynb**. _

I explored gender fluidity in sixteenth and seventeenth-century Britain using a corpus of just over 1000 texts from the period. I created this corpus using 25,368 texts from Early English Books Online (EEBO), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and Evans Early American Imprints, and filtered them using key words/phrases and dates. I organized and cleaned these texts, and standardized spelling as much as possible. I then created dictionaries of concordances (a method of exploring the context of key words and phrases, by showing the words and the passages around them), and graphed collocates (words that appear in proximity to the specified key word or phrase). I went on to perform sentiment analysis on the texts to gain some insight into whether references to my key words/phrases were negative or positive, and tracked how this sentiment changed over time.
